# Conv-LSTM SAR XAI
This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce the explainable AI (XAI) results for Conv-LSTM models applied to SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data. The methods demonstrated here are used for environmental monitoring and predictive modeling, particularly focused on wave height prediction using remote sensing data.

## Contents
- Integrated Gradients: Implementation for visualizing model decisions using integrated gradients for Conv-LSTM.
- Occlusion Sensitivity: Code for occlusion-based sensitivity analysis to assess the importance of different spatial features in SAR images.
## Key Features
- Conv-LSTM Model Architecture: This repository provides the code for reproducing XAI results for Conv-LSTM models trained on SAR data.
- Explainability Methods: Includes code for applying Integrated Gradients and Occlusion Sensitivity to analyze and explain the modelâ€™s predictions.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
Additional libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
## Usage
- Data Preparation: Ensure that the SAR data is preprocessed and aligned as described in the paper.
- Run XAI methods: Use the provided scripts to apply integrated gradients and occlusion sensitivity to the trained Conv-LSTM model.
- Detailed instructions on how to reproduce the results will be added soon.
